# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection

## Motivation
Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in the working-age population of the developed world. The condition is estimated to affect over 93 million people.

The need for a comprehensive and automated method of diabetic retinopathy screening has long been recognized, and previous efforts have made good progress using image classification, pattern recognition, and machine learning. With photos of eyes as input, the goal of this capstone is to create a new model, ideally resulting in realistic clinical potential.

* Computer Vision image classification has been a personal interest for years, in addition to classification on a large scale data set.
* Time is lost between patients getting their eyes scanned, having their images analyzed by doctors, and scheduling a follow-up appointment. By processing images in real-time, **ResNet50 model** would allow people to seek & schedule treatment the same day.
